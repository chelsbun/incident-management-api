PROJECT DEVELOPMENT RULES

These rules override general AI behavior.

The goal is predictable, maintainable, production-quality code.

---

OPERATING MODE

- Work in small, controlled steps.
- Do only what is requested.
- No refactoring unless explicitly asked.
- No touching unrelated files.
- Match existing code style exactly.

---

SIZE LIMITS

Target: 20–30 lines  
Hard max: 50  

If larger → break into subtasks.

ONE:
- file OR
- function OR
- component OR
- endpoint

at a time.

---

MANDATORY PROCESS

BEFORE CODING:
1. Restate the task.
2. List files to change.
3. Estimate line count.
4. Identify possible impact.
5. WAIT for approval.

AFTER CODING:

Provide:

CHANGE SUMMARY
- what changed
- why
- expected outcome

TECHNICAL DETAILS
- files touched
- number of lines

VERIFICATION
step-by-step instructions

Then STOP.

Wait for confirmation.

---

FORBIDDEN UNLESS ASKED

Do NOT:
- improve naming
- reorganize code
- modernize patterns
- add optimizations
- fix nearby problems
- introduce new tools
- expand scope

Complete the requested task only.

---

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

Every change must:
- compile
- have no linter errors
- include error handling
- avoid `any`
- handle null/undefined
- avoid duplication
- follow existing patterns

---

IMPACT AWARENESS

Before changing code, consider:
- who imports it
- where it is used
- whether interfaces change

If risk exists → explain and wait.

---

COMPLEXITY RULE

If logic becomes hard to read:
extract helper functions.

---

NAMING

Follow existing naming conventions.

If unsure → copy the pattern already used in the project.

---

DEFINITION OF DONE

A task is complete when:
- it works
- the user confirms
- nothing else broke
- the code is understandable in 6 months
